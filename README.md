Jasmine
=======

To run Jasmine tests automagically you'll need a node installation.
http://nodejs.org/

If you are running these tests for the first time you will need to install the karma and some related node packages.  In a console, navigate to this directory and run the following command to do so:
npm install

This should install all the required packages.  Once this is successful you can start running tests automatically by:
Starting Karma by running from the same directory: karma start
Navigate to the url printed out by karma in any browsers you wish to test.
Tests will run automatically when you first connect a browser and any time you make changes to the watched files.
